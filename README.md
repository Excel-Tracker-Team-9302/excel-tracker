# Release Notes


# Install Guide

INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
The following is a lsit of requirements for running the application from your localhost. This would be useful for development or debugging purposes for a future development team

PREREQUISITES 
You must have the following libraries installed in order to properly run the application on localhost.
  Node.js (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  Npm (installed with Node.js)
  Git (this is dependent on your platform, but is required to read and modify code on a GitHub repository)

DOWNLOAD/INSTALL
To download the repository on your computer, use the git clone <repository_url> to clone the repository onto a directory in your computer.

To interact with the live application, simply navigate to the applications url in a web browser. No additional libraries or downloads should be necessary to interact with the system in its deployed state.

To run the application directly from local host, clone the code's repository into a directory on your computer. Then, execute the following commands:

npm install
npm run

Note that this requires you to have npm and Node.js installed on your computer. The application will then be accessible from a localhost port in the web browser. This is useful for debugging and development purposes, not for real-user use. A full guide to installing and running a React project can be found on the React website.

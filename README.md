# Release Notes


# Install Guide

To interact with the live application, simply navigate to the applications url in a web browser. No additional libraries or downloads should be necessary to interact with the system in its deployed state.

To run the application directly from local host, clone the code's repository into a directory on your computer. Then, execute the following commands:

npm install
npm run

Note that this requires you to have npm and Node.js installed on your computer. The application will then be accessible from a localhost port in the web browser. This is useful for debugging and development purposes, not for real-user use. A full guide to installing and running a React project can be found on the React website.
